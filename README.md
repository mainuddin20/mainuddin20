👋 Hi, I’m Mainuddin (@mainuddin20), a passionate front-end developer with a strong focus on creating visually appealing, interactive, and user-friendly websites. I specialize in combining my expertise in front-end development with my love for animations and UI/UX design to build engaging digital experiences.

👀 I’m particularly interested in exploring the intersection of design and technology, where I can bring innovative ideas to life through smooth animations, intuitive interfaces, and responsive designs. My goal is to ensure every website I create is not only functional but also delivers a delightful user experience.

🌱 I’m currently diving deep into React animations, honing my skills in this area to further enhance my portfolio and build more dynamic websites. Learning how to craft engaging transitions and interactive elements is an exciting challenge that I’m passionate about mastering.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interactive web projects and creative animations using React. Whether it’s building a full-fledged website from scratch, or adding subtle animations to bring a design to life, I’m excited to work with like-minded individuals or teams who value creativity and attention to detail.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me at hossenmainuddin33@gmail.com for any collaboration opportunities, project discussions, or even just to chat about all things front-end development and design!

😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I’m a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to design details – I can easily spend hours tweaking a tiny visual element until it’s just right!
